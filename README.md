## üî∞ Introduction

Welcome! This repository documents my learning journey into **bare-metal C programming** for the **ATmega328P** microcontroller, the chip at the heart of the popular Arduino Uno.

This approach, also known as **register-level programming**, involves moving beyond the simple Arduino libraries (like `digitalWrite()`) to control the hardware directly. We do this by reading and writing to the microcontroller's special function registers.

The goals of this project are to:
- ‚ö° Gain a deep understanding of the ATmega328P architecture.
- üõ†Ô∏è Learn to configure and control peripherals from the ground up.
- üöÄ Write more efficient and optimized C code.
- üêß Get comfortable with the bare-metal development workflow.

üí° The aim is to **learn ‚Üí implement ‚Üí document** each concept step-by-step.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Environment

To follow along, you'll need a few hardware and software tools.

### Hardware (Physical)
* **Arduino Uno Board:** (or any other board with an ATmega328P).
* **Peripherals:** LEDs, resistors, push-buttons, 7-segment display, LCD, potentiometer, etc.
* **Breadboard & Jumper Wires**

### Software & Toolchain
* **Arduino IDE:** We won't use its libraries, but it provides the complete **AVR-GCC toolchain** (`avr-gcc`, `avr-objcopy`) and **AVRDUDE** (the uploader) in one easy install.
* **Code Editor:** Any text editor (like VS Code) to write C code.

### Simulation (recommended)
You can test most of this code without any physical hardware using these excellent simulators:
* **[Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/):** A powerful, free, in-browser simulator for Arduino, ESP32, and more.
* **[SimulIDE](https://www.simulide.com/):** A free, open-source real-time electronic circuit simulator for your desktop.
