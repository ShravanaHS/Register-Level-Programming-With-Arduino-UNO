# GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)

The first practical module! GPIO is the most fundamental concept in microcontrollers. It's how the chip interacts with the physical worldâ€”turning on LEDs, reading button presses, and sending signals to other components.

My goal here is to master controlling these pins directly by reading and writing to their registers.


---

## The 3 Key GPIO Registers

To control any pin, I need to work with three 8-bit registers. The `x` in the name stands for the port letter (`B`, `C`, or `D`).

### 1. `DDRx` â€“ Data Direction Register
* **Purpose:** This is the most important register. It sets the *direction* of each pin in the port (either INPUT or OUTPUT).
* This is exactly like the `TRIS` register I used with PIC microcontrollers.
* **Rule:** Each bit in this register controls the corresponding pin.
    * `1` = The pin is an **OUTPUT**.
    * `0` = The pin is an **INPUT** (this is the default state on power-up).

### 2. `PORTx` â€“ Port Data Register
* **Purpose:** This register has two different jobs, which depend on the pin's direction (set by `DDRx`).
* **Job 1 (If pin is an OUTPUT):** `PORTx` *writes* the value.
    * `1` = Drive the pin **HIGH** (e.g., 5V).
    * `0` = Drive the pin **LOW** (e.g., 0V).
* **Job 2 (If pin is an INPUT):** `PORTx` controls the *internal pull-up resistor*.
    * `1` = **Enable** the internal pull-up resistor. (This is great for buttons!)
    * `0` = **Disable** the pull-up (the pin is "floating").

### 3. `PINx` â€“ Port Input Pins Register
* **Purpose:** This is a **read-only** register. Its only job is to *read* the current digital state of a pin.
* **Rule:** If I read this register, it tells me if the physical pins are currently HIGH (`1`) or LOW (`0`). This is what I'll use to check if a button is pressed.

## The Core Skill: Bit Manipulation

I can't just write `DDRB = 1;` because that would set `PB0` but also clear the other 7 pins. The key is to change *only* the single bit I care about. This is done with bitwise operators (`|`, `&`, `~`).

### Method 1: The Individual Bit Method (Recommended)

This is for setting or clearing one bit at a time.

#### To Set a Bit (Set to `1`)
* **Use-Case:** Make a pin an **OUTPUT** (`DDRx`) or set an output pin **HIGH** (`PORTx`).
* **Operator:** Bitwise **OR (`|`)**.
* **Example:** Set `PB0` (Pin 0 on Port B) as an output.
    ```c
    DDRB = DDRB | (1 << DDB0);
    // Or the common shorthand:
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB0);
    ```
* **My Explanation:**
    1.  Assume `DDRB` is `00000000` (all inputs).
    2.  `(1 << DDB0)` means "take the number 1 and left-shift it 0 times". This creates a "bitmask": `00000001`.
    3.  We perform a bitwise `OR`:
        ```
          00000000  (Current DDRB value)
        | 00000001  (Our bitmask)
        ----------------
        = 00000001  (The new DDRB value)
        ```
    4.  The `OR` operation sets the 0th bit to `1` and leaves all other bits untouched.

* **Example (Setting multiple bits):**
    ```c
    // Set PB0 and PB1 as output
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB0) | (1 << DDB1);

    // Set the first four LSBs (0, 1, 2, 3) as output
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB0) | (1 << DDB1) | (1 << DDB2) | (1 << DDB3);
    ```

#### To Clear a Bit (Set to `0`)
* **Use-Case:** Make a pin an **INPUT** (`DDRx`) or set an output pin **LOW** (`PORTx`).
* **Operators:** Bitwise **AND (`&`)** and **NOT (`~`)**.
* **Example:** Set `PB0` as an input.
    ```c
    DDRB = DDRB & (~(1 << DDB0));
    // Or the common shorthand:
    DDRB &= ~(1 << DDB0);
    ```
* **Explanation:**
    1.  `(1 << DDB0)` creates the mask: `00000001`.
    2.  `~(1 << DDB0)` *inverts* the mask: `11111110`.
    3.  The `AND` operation keeps all bits the same *except* for the 0th bit, which is forced to `0`.

* **Example (Setting LSBs as input):**
    ```c
    DDRB &= ~((1 << DDB0) | (1 << DDB1) | (1 << DDB2) | (1 << DDB3));
    ```

### Method 2: The 8-Bit "Fast" Method
* This is useful when I want to configure the *entire port* at once.
* **Example:** Configure LSBs (0-3) as input and MSBs (4-7) as output.
    ```c
    // Using binary is easy to read
    DDRB = 0b11110000;
    
    // Or using hexadecimal (which is shorter)
    DDRB = 0xF0;
    ```
* **Example:** Set MSBs high and LSBs low on an output port.
    ```c
    // Note: This assumes DDRB is already set correctly
    PORTB = 0xF0; // 0b11110000
    ```

## ðŸ’¡ Project 1: Blinking an LED

Time to put the theory to the test. This code will blink the built-in LED on the Arduino Uno board, which is connected to **Arduino Pin 13**. Looking at the pinout, this is `PB5` (Pin 5 on Port B).

### `main.c` (Bare-Metal Blink)

```c
/*
 * This is the bare-metal equivalent of the Arduino "Blink" sketch.
 * We must define the clock speed for the _delay_ms() function to work.
 */
#define F_CPU 16000000UL // Arduino Uno clock speed is 16MHz

#include <avr/io.h>      // This file has all the register definitions (DDRB, PORTB, etc.)
#include <util/delay.h>  // This file has the _delay_ms() function

int main(void)
{
    // --- SETUP ---
    // This part runs once.

    // Configure led pin (PB5) as an output.
    // We set the 5th bit of the Data Direction Register for Port B to 1.
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB5); 


    // --- LOOP ---
    // This part runs forever.
    while (1) 
    {
        // 1. Turn LED ON
        // Set the 5th bit of the PORTB register to 1 (HIGH).
        PORTB |= (1 << PB5);
        
        _delay_ms(1000); // Wait for 1000ms (1 second)

        // 2. Turn LED OFF
        // Clear the 5th bit of the PORTB register to 0 (LOW).
        PORTB &= ~(1 << PB5);
        
        _delay_ms(1000); // Wait for 1 second
    }
}
```

## How to Read an Input Pin (The `PINx` Register)

The final register, `PINx`, is for reading. Its main purpose is to get the status of input pins, for example, in an `if` statement.

* **Example:** Check if a button connected to `PINB0` is pressed.

```c
// --- IN SETUP ---
// 1. Set PB0 as an input (clear the bit)
DDRB &= ~(1 << DDB0);  

// 2. Enable the internal pull-up resistor for PB0 (set the bit)
// This means the pin will be HIGH by default and LOW when pressed
PORTB |= (1 << PB0);   

// --- IN LOOP ---
while(1)
{
    // We read the PINB register
    // We use the bitwise AND to "mask" out all bits except PINB0.
    // If PINB0 is 0 (LOW), the whole expression becomes 0.
    
    // The "!" inverts the logic, so "if NOT (HIGH)" means "if (LOW)"
    if ( !(PINB & (1 << PINB0)) )
    {
        // Button is pressed (pin is LOW)
        // Do something... (e.g., turn on an LED)
    }
    else
    {
        // Button is not pressed (pin is HIGH)
        // Do something else... (e.g., turn off the LED)
    }
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ Project 2: Interfacing a 7-Segment Display

The next logical step after blinking a single LED is controlling multiple LEDs at once. A 7-segment display is perfect for this, as it's essentially 7+ LEDs arranged in a figure-8 pattern to display numbers and some letters.

### Working Principle: Common Cathode vs. Common Anode

There are two types of 7-segment displays, and the only difference is the polarity of the LEDs:

1.  **Common Cathode (CC):** All the negative terminals (cathodes) of the LEDs are connected to a single pin. This common pin must be connected to **GND**. To turn on a segment, we send a **HIGH (`1`)** signal to its individual pin.
2.  **Common Anode (CA):** All the positive terminals (anodes) of the LEDs are connected. This common pin must be connected to **VCC (5V)**. To turn on a segment, we send a **LOW (`0`)** signal to its individual pin (the logic is inverted).

For this project, I will be using a **Common Cathode** display.



### Hardware Connections

I will use the entire `PORTD` of the ATmega328P to drive the display. This makes the code simple as I can send one byte to control all segments at once.

* A **current-limiting resistor** (typically 220Î© or 330Î©) must be connected in series with each segment pin (a-g) to prevent burning out the LEDs.
* The **common pin** of the 7-segment display must be connected to **GND**.

| Segment Pin | ATmega328P Pin |
| :---------: | :------------: |
|      a      |      PD0       |
|      b      |      PD1       |
|      c      |      PD2       |
|      d      |      PD3       |
|      e      |      PD4       |
|      f      |      PD5       |
|      g      |      PD6       |

![Real 7-Segment Display](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200413202916/Untitled-Diagram-237.png)

### Theory & Segment Mapping

To display a number, I need to send a specific 8-bit pattern to `PORTD`. The bits of the `PORTD` register correspond to the display's segments as follows (bit 7, the most significant bit, will control the decimal point, which we won't use here).

| Bit         | 7  | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| :---------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Segment** | dp | g | f | e | d | c | b | a |

Here is the truth table that translates each decimal digit into its 8-bit binary pattern and the final hex code I'll use in my C code array.

| Decimal Number | Binary `(dp g f e d c b a)` | Hex Equivalent |
| :------------: | :-------------------------: | :------------: |
|       0        |        `0011 1111`          |     `0x3F`     |
|       1        |        `0000 0110`          |     `0x06`     |
|       2        |        `0101 1011`          |     `0x5B`     |
|       3        |        `0100 1111`          |     `0x4F`     |
|       4        |        `0110 0110`          |     `0x66`     |
|       5        |        `0110 1101`          |     `0x6D`     |
|       6        |        `0111 1100`          |     `0x7C`     |
|       7        |        `0000 0111`          |     `0x07`     |
|       8        |        `0111 1111`          |     `0x7F`     |
|       9        |        `0110 1111`          |     `0x6F`     |

### `main.c` (0-9 Counter)

This code will configure `PORTD` as an output port and then loop through the array of hex codes, sending each pattern to the display with a delay to create a 0-9 counter.

```c
//// This array stores the hex codes for digits 0-9.
unsigned char segment[10] = {0x3F, 0x06, 0x5B, 0x4F, 0x66, 0x6D, 0x7C, 0x07, 0x7F, 0x6F};

void setup() {
  //set port D as output or Configure all 8 pins of PORTD as outputs.
// 0xFF is the hexadecimal equivalent of 0b11111111.
  DDRD = 0xFF;
}

void loop() {
  // printing numbers
  for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
    PORTD = segment[i];
    delay(1000);
  }
  delay(2000);

}

## ðŸ’¡ Project 3: Interfacing a 16x2 LCD Display

Displaying numbers is useful, but for showing text and full words, I need to use an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). For this project, I'll interface a standard 16x2 character LCD.

### How a 16x2 LCD Works

A 16x2 LCD can display 16 characters per row, with 2 rows in total. Each character is not a simple segment, but is actually formed by a **5x8 dot matrix** of tiny pixels.


Turning individual dots on and off is complex, so these displays have a built-in controller chip to handle that job. The most common one is the **Hitachi HD44780**. My task is simply to send commands and character data to this controller.

The controller has two important registers:
1.  **Instruction Register (IR):** I send commands here, like "clear the screen," "move the cursor to the second row," or "turn the display on."
2.  **Data Register (DR):** I send the actual character data (ASCII values) here to be displayed at the current cursor location.

### LCD Memory Map

Each of the 32 character positions has a specific address in the Display Data RAM (DDRAM). To print something at a specific location, I first send a command to move the cursor to that address.

* **Row 1:** Addresses `0x80` to `0x8F`
* **Row 2:** Addresses `0xC0` to `0xCF`

### LCD Pinout

The standard 16-pin LCD has the following layout:

| Pin | Name | Function                                                                  |
| :--: | :--: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | VSS  | Ground (0V)                                                               |
| 2   | VDD  | Power Supply (+5V)                                                        |
| 3   | V0/VE | Contrast Adjustment (Connected to potentiometer)                          |
| 4   | **RS** | **Register Select:** `0` = Command (Instruction), `1` = Data              |
| 5   | **RW** | **Read/Write:** `0` = Write to LCD, `1` = Read from LCD (usually tied to GND) |
| 6   | **EN** | **Enable:** A HIGH-to-LOW pulse latches the data on the data pins.         |
| 7-14| D0-D7| **Data Bus Pins:** Carries the 8 bits of data or command.                 |
| 15  | A/LED+ | Backlight Anode (+5V)                                                     |
| 16  | K/LED- | Backlight Cathode (GND)                                                   |


 ![LCD Display](https://www.etechnophiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/16x2-LCD-Pinout-Specifications-Applications.jpg) 

### 8-bit vs. 4-bit Mode

The HD44780 controller can be operated in two modes:

* **8-bit Mode:** Uses all 8 data pins (D0-D7). It's faster and the code is simpler, but it requires 8 GPIO pins from the microcontroller just for data.
* **4-bit Mode:** Uses only 4 data pins (D4-D7). It saves GPIO pins but is slightly slower and more complex to program, as each 8-bit command/data byte must be sent in two 4-bit chunks (called "nibbles").

For this project, I will implement the simpler **8-bit mode**.

### Hardware Connections (ATmega328P)

* The 3 control pins (`RS`, `RW`, `EN`) will be connected to `PORTB`.
* The 8 data pins (`D0`-`D7`) will be connected to `PORTD`.

| LCD Pin | ATmega328P Pin |
| :-----: | :------------: |
|   RS    |      PB0       |
|   RW    |      PB1       |
|   EN    |      PB2       |
|  D0-D7  |     PD0-PD7    |

### Essential LCD Commands

These are the basic commands I need to send to the Instruction Register (`RS=0`) to initialize and control the LCD.

| Hex Code | Command Description                     |
| :------: | :-------------------------------------- |
|  `0x38`  | Initialize the LCD in 8-bit mode, 2 lines, 5x8 font. |
|  `0x0C`  | Turn Display ON, Cursor OFF.            |
|  `0x06`  | Auto-increment cursor position after each character. |
|  `0x01`  | Clear the entire display screen.        |
|  `0x80`  | Force cursor to the beginning of the 1st line. |
|  `0xC0`  | Force cursor to the beginning of the 2nd line. |

## ðŸ’¡ Project 4: Reading a Push Button (Switch Interface)

After controlling outputs (LEDs, LCDs), the next step is to get inputs from the user. The simplest form of input is a push button or switch.

### The Problem: "Floating" Pins

I can't just connect a button to a GPIO pin and leave it at that. When the button is **not** pressed, the input pin is connected to... nothing. This is called a **"floating"** state.

A floating pin is like a tiny antenna; it can randomly pick up electrical noise from the air and report `HIGH` or `LOW` back to the chip, making my program completely unreliable.

To fix this, I must use a **pull-up** or **pull-down** resistor. This resistor ensures the pin is always in a known, stable state (`HIGH` or `LOW`) when the button isn't being pressed.

---
 ![pull up](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18085af6-9969-42a6-9795-a74250633242) 
### Logic 1: The Pull-Down Resistor

In a pull-down setup, a resistor (e.g., 10kÎ©) connects the GPIO pin directly to **Ground (GND)**. The button is set up to connect the pin to **VCC (5V)** when pressed.

* **Button NOT Pressed:** The resistor "pulls" the pin's voltage down to GND. The pin reads **LOW (0)**.
* **Button IS Pressed:** The button creates a direct path to VCC, which "overpowers" the resistor. The pin reads **HIGH (1)**.

This logic is straightforward: **LOW = Off, HIGH = On**.



---

### Logic 2: The Pull-Up Resistor

In a pull-up setup, the resistor connects the GPIO pin directly to **VCC (5V)**. The button is set up to connect the pin to **GND** when pressed.

* **Button NOT Pressed:** The resistor "pulls" the pin's voltage up to VCC. The pin reads **HIGH (1)**.
* **Button IS Pressed:** The button creates a direct path to GND. The pin reads **LOW (0)**.

This logic is **inverted**: **HIGH = Off, LOW = On**.



---

### Special Feature: The ATmega328P's Internal Pull-Ups

The ATmega328P (and most modern microcontrollers) has a very useful feature: **built-in pull-up resistors** that I can enable or disable in software. This saves me from having to add an external resistor to my circuit.

I can enable the internal pull-up on any pin by:
1.  Setting the pin as an **INPUT** (e.g., `DDRD &= ~(1 << PD2);`).
2.  Writing a `1` to that pin's bit in the **`PORTx`** register (e.g., `PORTD |= (1 << PD2);`).

When I use the internal pull-up, I must use the **inverted logic (Logic 2)** in my code: I check for a **LOW (0)** signal to detect a button press. This is the most common and efficient method.

#### `main.c` 

This code checks if `PD2` (Arduino Pin 2) is `HIGH`. If it is, it turns on the LED at `PB5` (Arduino Pin 13).

```c

void setup() {
  //make PB5 13 AS output
  //make PD2 2 as inpot

  DDRB |= (1<<DDB5);
  DDRD &= ~(1<<DDD2);
}

void loop() {
  // check the status of PD2 BASED ON that change the output value
  //for pull down logic
  if(PIND &(1<<PIND2)){
    PORTB |= (1<<PB5);
  }
  else{
    PORTB &= ~(1<<PB5);
  }

}

## ðŸ’¡ Project 5: Interfacing a Relay (Controlling High-Power Devices)

This project is a major step up. So far, I've controlled low-power components like LEDs. But what about controlling a high-voltage device, like a 220V AC light bulb or a fan?

The GPIO pins of the ATmega328P can only provide a tiny amount of current at 5V. Connecting them directly to a high-power device would instantly destroy the chip.

The solution is to use a **Relay**.

### What is a Relay?

A relay is an **electromechanical switch**. It's a way to control a high-power circuit using a low-power signal.



### How Does a Relay Work?

A relay has two separate parts, electrically isolated from each other:

1.  **The Control Side (Low-Voltage):**
    * This side has a small **electromagnet (coil)**.
    * When I send a 5V signal (from my microcontroller) to this coil, it becomes a magnet.
    * This magnetism *pulls* a metal switch on the other side.

2.  **The Switch Side (High-Voltage):**
    * This side is just a physical switch, exactly like a light switch on your wall. It has three terminals:
    * **COM (Common):** The "input" for the high-voltage power.
    * **NO (Normally Open):** This contact is *disconnected* by default. The high-voltage circuit is OFF. When the coil is energized, the switch is pulled to this position, turning the circuit ON.
    * **NC (Normally Closed):** This contact is *connected* by default. The high-voltage circuit is ON. When the coil is energized, the switch is pulled *away* from this position, turning the circuit OFF.

By sending a 5V signal to the coil, I can safely open or close a 220V AC circuit.

### The Transistor Driver Circuit

There's one more problem: The relay's coil, while low-voltage, still needs more current (e.g., 50-100mA) than the ATmega328P pin (max 40mA) can safely supply.

I must use a **transistor (like a BC547 or 2N2222)** to act as a *second* switch.

1.  The GPIO pin sends a small, safe signal (5V, ~5mA) to the transistor's **Base**.
2.  This small signal "opens the gate" of the transistor.
3.  This allows a much larger current to flow from an external 5V supply, through the relay's coil, and through the transistor's **Collector** and **Emitter** to GND.
4.  A **flyback diode** (e.g., 1N4007) is placed across the coil to protect the transistor from a voltage spike when the relay turns off.

### Hardware Connections

For this project, I'll control the relay with a push button.

* **Input:** Push Button on `PD7` (Arduino Pin 7), using **pull-down logic**.
* **Output:** Transistor Base connected (via a 1kÎ© resistor) to `PB0` (Arduino Pin 8).
* **Relay Coil:** Connected to 5V and the transistor's Collector.
* **High-Voltage Device:** Connected to the COM and NO (Normally Open) terminals.

### `main.c` (Button-Controlled Relay)

This code will read the button on `PD7`. If the button is pressed (`HIGH`), it will send a `HIGH` signal to `PB0`, which turns on the transistor, which in turn energizes the relay and switches on the high-voltage device.

```c
/*
 * Project 5: Button-Controlled Relay
 * Reads a push button on PD7 (pull-down) to control a relay
 * via a transistor on PB0.
 */
#define F_CPU 16000000UL // 16MHz clock

#include <avr/io.h>
#include <util/delay.h>

#define RELAY_PIN   PB0  // (Arduino Pin 8) -> Transistor Base
#define BUTTON_PIN  PIND7 // (Arduino Pin 7) -> Button Input

int main(void)
{
    // --- SETUP ---
    // 1. Set RELAY_PIN (PB0) as an OUTPUT
    DDRB |= (1 << RELAY_PIN);
    
    // 2. Set BUTTON_PIN (PD7) as an INPUT
    DDRD &= ~(1 << BUTTON_PIN);
    
    // --- LOOP ---
    while (1)
    {
        // Check the status of the PIND register using pull-down logic
        if (PIND & (1 << BUTTON_PIN))
        {
            // Button is pressed (HIGH), turn Relay ON
            // (Send 5V to the transistor base)
            PORTB |= (1 << RELAY_PIN);
        }
        else
        {
            // Button is not pressed (LOW), turn Relay OFF
            // (Send 0V to the transistor base)
            PORTB &= ~(1 << RELAY_PIN);
        }
    }
}
```
