# GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)

The first practical module! GPIO is the most fundamental concept in microcontrollers. It's how the chip interacts with the physical worldâ€”turning on LEDs, reading button presses, and sending signals to other components.

My goal here is to master controlling these pins directly by reading and writing to their registers.

## The 3 Key GPIO Registers

To control any pin, I need to work with three 8-bit registers. The `x` in the name stands for the port letter (`B`, `C`, or `D`).

### 1. `DDRx` â€“ Data Direction Register
* **Purpose:** This is the most important register. It sets the *direction* of each pin in the port (either INPUT or OUTPUT).
* This is exactly like the `TRIS` register I used with PIC microcontrollers.
* **Rule:** Each bit in this register controls the corresponding pin.
    * `1` = The pin is an **OUTPUT**.
    * `0` = The pin is an **INPUT** (this is the default state on power-up).

### 2. `PORTx` â€“ Port Data Register
* **Purpose:** This register has two different jobs, which depend on the pin's direction (set by `DDRx`).
* **Job 1 (If pin is an OUTPUT):** `PORTx` *writes* the value.
    * `1` = Drive the pin **HIGH** (e.g., 5V).
    * `0` = Drive the pin **LOW** (e.g., 0V).
* **Job 2 (If pin is an INPUT):** `PORTx` controls the *internal pull-up resistor*.
    * `1` = **Enable** the internal pull-up resistor. (This is great for buttons!)
    * `0` = **Disable** the pull-up (the pin is "floating").

### 3. `PINx` â€“ Port Input Pins Register
* **Purpose:** This is a **read-only** register. Its only job is to *read* the current digital state of a pin.
* **Rule:** If I read this register, it tells me if the physical pins are currently HIGH (`1`) or LOW (`0`). This is what I'll use to check if a button is pressed.

## The Core Skill: Bit Manipulation

I can't just write `DDRB = 1;` because that would set `PB0` but also clear the other 7 pins. The key is to change *only* the single bit I care about. This is done with bitwise operators (`|`, `&`, `~`).

### Method 1: The Individual Bit Method (Recommended)

This is for setting or clearing one bit at a time.

#### To Set a Bit (Set to `1`)
* **Use-Case:** Make a pin an **OUTPUT** (`DDRx`) or set an output pin **HIGH** (`PORTx`).
* **Operator:** Bitwise **OR (`|`)**.
* **Example:** Set `PB0` (Pin 0 on Port B) as an output.
    ```c
    DDRB = DDRB | (1 << DDB0);
    // Or the common shorthand:
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB0);
    ```
* **My Explanation:**
    1.  Assume `DDRB` is `00000000` (all inputs).
    2.  `(1 << DDB0)` means "take the number 1 and left-shift it 0 times". This creates a "bitmask": `00000001`.
    3.  We perform a bitwise `OR`:
        ```
          00000000  (Current DDRB value)
        | 00000001  (Our bitmask)
        ----------------
        = 00000001  (The new DDRB value)
        ```
    4.  The `OR` operation sets the 0th bit to `1` and leaves all other bits untouched.

* **Example (Setting multiple bits):**
    ```c
    // Set PB0 and PB1 as output
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB0) | (1 << DDB1);

    // Set the first four LSBs (0, 1, 2, 3) as output
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB0) | (1 << DDB1) | (1 << DDB2) | (1 << DDB3);
    ```

#### To Clear a Bit (Set to `0`)
* **Use-Case:** Make a pin an **INPUT** (`DDRx`) or set an output pin **LOW** (`PORTx`).
* **Operators:** Bitwise **AND (`&`)** and **NOT (`~`)**.
* **Example:** Set `PB0` as an input.
    ```c
    DDRB = DDRB & (~(1 << DDB0));
    // Or the common shorthand:
    DDRB &= ~(1 << DDB0);
    ```
* **Explanation:**
    1.  `(1 << DDB0)` creates the mask: `00000001`.
    2.  `~(1 << DDB0)` *inverts* the mask: `11111110`.
    3.  The `AND` operation keeps all bits the same *except* for the 0th bit, which is forced to `0`.

* **Example (Setting LSBs as input):**
    ```c
    DDRB &= ~((1 << DDB0) | (1 << DDB1) | (1 << DDB2) | (1 << DDB3));
    ```

### Method 2: The 8-Bit "Fast" Method
* This is useful when I want to configure the *entire port* at once.
* **Example:** Configure LSBs (0-3) as input and MSBs (4-7) as output.
    ```c
    // Using binary is easy to read
    DDRB = 0b11110000;
    
    // Or using hexadecimal (which is shorter)
    DDRB = 0xF0;
    ```
* **Example:** Set MSBs high and LSBs low on an output port.
    ```c
    // Note: This assumes DDRB is already set correctly
    PORTB = 0xF0; // 0b11110000
    ```

## ðŸ’¡ Project 1: Blinking an LED

Time to put the theory to the test. This code will blink the built-in LED on the Arduino Uno board, which is connected to **Arduino Pin 13**. Looking at the pinout, this is `PB5` (Pin 5 on Port B).

### `main.c` (Bare-Metal Blink)

```c
/*
 * This is the bare-metal equivalent of the Arduino "Blink" sketch.
 * We must define the clock speed for the _delay_ms() function to work.
 */
#define F_CPU 16000000UL // Arduino Uno clock speed is 16MHz

#include <avr/io.h>      // This file has all the register definitions (DDRB, PORTB, etc.)
#include <util/delay.h>  // This file has the _delay_ms() function

int main(void)
{
    // --- SETUP ---
    // This part runs once.

    // Configure led pin (PB5) as an output.
    // We set the 5th bit of the Data Direction Register for Port B to 1.
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB5); 


    // --- LOOP ---
    // This part runs forever.
    while (1) 
    {
        // 1. Turn LED ON
        // Set the 5th bit of the PORTB register to 1 (HIGH).
        PORTB |= (1 << PB5);
        
        _delay_ms(1000); // Wait for 1000ms (1 second)

        // 2. Turn LED OFF
        // Clear the 5th bit of the PORTB register to 0 (LOW).
        PORTB &= ~(1 << PB5);
        
        _delay_ms(1000); // Wait for 1 second
    }
}
```

## How to Read an Input Pin (The `PINx` Register)

The final register, `PINx`, is for reading. Its main purpose is to get the status of input pins, for example, in an `if` statement.

* **Example:** Check if a button connected to `PINB0` is pressed.

```c
// --- IN SETUP ---
// 1. Set PB0 as an input (clear the bit)
DDRB &= ~(1 << DDB0);  

// 2. Enable the internal pull-up resistor for PB0 (set the bit)
// This means the pin will be HIGH by default and LOW when pressed
PORTB |= (1 << PB0);   

// --- IN LOOP ---
while(1)
{
    // We read the PINB register
    // We use the bitwise AND to "mask" out all bits except PINB0.
    // If PINB0 is 0 (LOW), the whole expression becomes 0.
    
    // The "!" inverts the logic, so "if NOT (HIGH)" means "if (LOW)"
    if ( !(PINB & (1 << PINB0)) )
    {
        // Button is pressed (pin is LOW)
        // Do something... (e.g., turn on an LED)
    }
    else
    {
        // Button is not pressed (pin is HIGH)
        // Do something else... (e.g., turn off the LED)
    }
}
```
